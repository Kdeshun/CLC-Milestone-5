For Milestone 6, the focus is on enhancing the e-commerce application with new features and improvements. The technical approach involves leveraging modern frontend frameworks like React or Angular for a dynamic user interface, while the backend will expand the API with RESTful endpoints for functionalities such as order management and product reviews. Key design decisions include implementing a service layer for better separation of concerns, enhancing security with JWT and OAuth for authentication, and enforcing strong input validation. Known issues such as UI inconsistencies, performance bottlenecks, and integration challenges have been identified, along with risks like scope creep and security vulnerabilities. The DDL scripts outline necessary database changes, including the addition of a ProductReview table. Key classes such as User, Product, Order, and ProductReview encapsulate core functionalities, while security measures focus on robust authentication, data encryption, and session management. Weekly status updates track progress from user registration to order management, addressing challenges and outlining next steps for successful implementation.
