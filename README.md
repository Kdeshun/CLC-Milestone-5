Milestone 5: Product Display and Update/Delete Modules
Overview
This milestone focuses on implementing the product display and update/delete functionalities for the e-commerce application. The goal is to provide users with the ability to view, add, edit, and delete products seamlessly.
Technical Approach
The application leverages Spring MVC and Thymeleaf for the presentation layer, Spring Data JPA for data access, and Bootstrap for responsive design. Key components include:
Product Entity: Represents product attributes and behaviors.
ProductRepository: Interface for CRUD operations.
ProductService: Contains business logic.
ProductController: Manages HTTP requests related to products.
Thymeleaf Templates: For rendering views.
Comprehensive unit and integration testing are conducted to ensure functionality.
Key Technical Design Decisions
Layered Architecture: Promotes separation of concerns.
Spring Data JPA: Simplifies data access.
Thymeleaf: Facilitates dynamic views.
RESTful API Design: Enhances clarity in operations.
Bootstrap: Ensures responsive design.
Validation and Error Handling: Improves user experience.
Documentation Practices: Supports team collaboration.
Known Issues
Database Connection Stability: Intermittent connectivity issues.
Data Inconsistencies: Possible UI updates lagging behind database changes.
Responsive Design Limitations: Some elements may not display correctly on mobile.
